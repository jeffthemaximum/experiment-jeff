# Jeff's reading of the Blog. Questions, suggestions, otherses.

### Questions
- **What happened to Kate's context app? https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/130357966982/kates-project-context-app**
The context app lives in two places. You can find the context information for each user in the sidebar in FrontApp. You can also see context information by appending ```/context``` to any user profile in the browser.

- **What happened to sergey?** We let Sergey go in November 2015. If you'd like to know why we let Sergey go, or why we've let anyone go in the past I'm happy to answer any and all specific questions! In Experiment's history Denny and I have let a number of people go including Anukul, Bobby, Ezekiel, Charlie, Andrew Mak, Becca, Andrew Wong, Sergey. The people not on this list (Oscar, Ryan, George) left voluntarily. Oscar is now working at Oscar. Ryan is working at Stripe. George is working at Etsy. I hope I'm not missing anyone!

- **What does this mean --> "we made the decision to stop manually driving projects and itâ€™s resulted in a large drop off in projects launched." - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/130629842272/october-update**
Outbound emails drove our project growth. When we send out a batch of emails, we continue to see trickle in effects from those solicitations. Around June 2015 we stopped sending all outbound emails.

- **Does this content still exist? --> Iâ€™ve already started documenting the human help I would give someone if I were to walk them through project create on the phone here: https://experiment.helpjuice.com/13290-Creating-A-Project ... https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/130672106937/automating-the-funnel-starting-at-the-top**

Helpjuice is dead. We never really populated much of it. It is good idea, but ideally I would like to build our own forum instead. We could use a 3rd party platform, but Helpjuice was not the right one. I would like for users to be able to answer questions from other users. The problem with the platform we were using is the content was only generated by staff.

- **At what point does researcher write results?
    - https://experiment.com/projects/how-does-a-parasite-create-zombie-like-behavior/results** It is still unclear. Right now researchers write results when they feel like it. We do a poor job of setting expectations for the scientist here.
    
- **I'm still a little unclear on the emoji rating system in admin's project/review pages. What do these actually get used for?
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/132434474427/a-more-accurate-metric-for-leads**
I mostly use the ðŸ‘Ž to filter out all bad projects. I think I am the only person that uses this. Maybe Christina does too. It is a janky system that helps me organize which projects to ignore. This needs to be revisited.

- **Did this ever get fixed?
    - In-page login for comment walls. This is super important! Right now, trying to comment anywhere redirects you off page, to a blank registration page w/o context, and then you donâ€™t always get redirected back to the original page you were looking at. 
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/134160310007/more-comments-more-discussion-more-relevance** To my knowledge this did not get fixed. If you want to make this your first project, go for it!

- **Do researchers have an easy interface for creating journal articles? I'm confident they can do this themselves if they had a good interface and good examples. 
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/134310590512/how-to-make-results** They do not. We haven't built this. 

- **Do experiment gift cards still exist?** They do not.

- **What's the status of this wishlist?
    - described here: https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/139371962147/the-evolution-of-grants
    - github link to actual doc here: https://github.com/experiment/experiment-comm/issues/1067** I attempted this and failed.

- **Current challenge grant page seems outdated. For example, Fish grant says, "On May 3, 2016, the project with the most backers will receive a $1,500 grant." and it listed a current grant.
    - https://experiment.com/grants** We need to design a "finished" grant page. That wasn't the scope of the project and got forgotten about. :(
    

- **What's experiment's RFP process? Form? Email?
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/139410964267/zika-grants** Currently the only way to do a RFP is to contact Cindy or someone at experiment. We do have a grants@experiment.com but haven't had any inbound.
    

- **What's the status of the project wizard? Is this still a thing?
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/139434118307/medium-stand-up** George and I finished this last fall. If you go to create a project it starts once you see the first page of project edit. I can show you where this lives.

- **What's the engineering that went in to this?
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/141610967567/shadowban** You will have to ask Denny this question.

- **Grant's are monitored for cheating. How?
    - "Only ongoing things are to monitor payments for cheating and help Daniel with any technical requests he may be getting (check #grants channel)."
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/142177391612/grants-handoff** We keep track of IP address and name on credit card and manually check to see if anyone has been cheating. There is a table for this per project.

- **Where did these 5 whys come from? Do Experiment engineers use this process frequent to learn from bugs?
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/143082486792/new-pledge-form** I think the process is asking questions until you get to the root of the problem. This isn't a formal process that we use here, but now that I'm seeing it it looks like a good one.

- **Tiers and rewards... I understand this goes against the mission "all proceeds go to science". But, the potential for this to help growth is big. What's the current thinking here?
    - I see this: "That said, there can be something very meaningful in a tangible unique artifact, or an experience of collaborating. If we can find ways to do this without selling short the science, then Iâ€™m for trying it out." from https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/144097701167/responding-to-kates-profitability-post
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/143826174732/profitability** This is a question for Kate. If you are interested in my responses for this blog post you can find them in Slack in the #tuesday channel.
    ```Higher Rates:*â€‹
I would be ok with sticking to 5% + payment processing, but not okay with 10% flat fee

upside: we make more money
downside: this is incredibly difficult for me to explain on the phone

â€‹*Minimum pledge:*â€‹

I want to keep the minimum pledge at $1 because I think there is value worth more than what we pay in payment processing fees to acquire a donor who gives $1, especially a donor who gives $1 2x.

â€‹*Bigger Projects:*â€‹

Iâ€™ve been against bigger projects since the weâ€™ve started. I believe that we need to build a product that serves users with smaller projects or we will never succeed. The hardest problem is building a product that can service small (or large) projects without experiment staff help. I still do not think weâ€™ve given this a good effort. I would invest in a product or product+community that removes C and X from the pipeline.

Big projects that are good are also hard to find and time consuming. They also expect more from us, staff

Tiers*â€‹:
Iâ€™m into this. I always try to incorporate this into my calls. If every project can find a way for their backers to contribute (voting on something, visiting the lab, some small form of participating) we will get better engagement. Tiers is a good way to get people to pay for engagement, which is a behavior we want that is very rare on experiment right now.

â€‹*Rewards*â€‹:
I am somewhat okay with getting researchers to use Teespring to raise money outside of experiment and adding this to the project (not during their campaign), but am against showing researchers raising money for t-shirts on the experiment platform. However I am into selling Experiment branded merchandise on an Experiment store. If we do shark week as a grant you could buy a sharkweek shirt and the money goes to share research.

Agree :100: with needing to decide on numbers and have an accurate system to track these numbers.

â€‹*On raising money:*â€‹ We arenâ€™t raising money right now.

â€‹*Other options:*â€‹ I am interested in doing hackathons every month where we build small things that are â€‹*useful*â€‹ to scientists. Grant Search, Levâ€™s ucanhazpdf@gmail.com bot


- **Do these happen? Are these the Friday events? "If youâ€™re in NYC, come to one of our weekly happy hours!"
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/143950342592/experiment-may-update** Yes they do! The next one is this Friday.

- **Newsletter. How is this made? Can I sit with someone and see them do it?
    - https://experiment.com/admin/newsletters** Kate is making one right now! https://experiment.com/admin/newsletters



### Suggestions
- Make 'JELLY' more public.
    - This is everything:
    - "There is a special feeling we pursue, which we call â€˜jellyâ€™. Jelly is the fuzzy-stomach feeling that happens when science connects two different people. Sometimes it happens in really great lab notes, sometimes itâ€™s when youâ€™re standing on a hill with a pick-axe realizing youâ€™ve helped to dig up a dinosaur. It does happen currently on Experiment, but in isolated pockets and for various reasons. This feeling that we package, make possible, and hand-deliver is the basis of the value-exchange. Fund science, get jelly. I believe there are people who want jelly."

- Journal. This is also everything --> https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/132258225517/journal-launch-post

- Results. This needs to happen. I went to this one looking for results and found nothing. Where are they? Journal? Lab Notes?
    - https://experiment.com/projects/the-gmo-corn-experiment/labnotes

- Some projects fail, some succeed. Why? This 'why' should be documented
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/133563119097/how-did-the-october-projects-do
    - More: "Looking back on my observations from the first day, it was easy to predict that Lindsey would get funded no matter what." From: https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/139371962147/the-evolution-of-grants

- Payouts. This shouldn't be a problem. Why are we ever doing it manually through Stripe? Every edge case should be documented, and there should be code/interfaces documented that allow community or engineers to correct any issues.

- Where are we now in the life cycle of JOURNAL?

- What's the status of our heroku dyno situation? Why does memory creep up over course of day?
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/134932365377/looking-into-our-heroku-dyno-setup

- Artificial deadlines are definitely a good way to go. This works wonders with kids and classrooms, and what works for kids, works for anyone. This is how you get more people to follow through on creating projects
    - "We know how to get scientists to start with artificial deadlines. Last week we incorporated a new artificial deadline combined with a grant for $2,000. For me, calls have never been easier."
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/136802229712/i-think-this-could-work

- We should pickup someone in education for a grants search, just like what happened with Jason
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/136802229712/i-think-this-could-work

- Crowd funded and crowd enabled grants
    - "The other way to think about this is if we halved the cost of running a grant from $2000 to $668, then weâ€™d be at break even. Can we get $668 of costs per grant cycle? I think so, if we enabled crowdfunded and crowdsupported grant making."

### Valuable to learn from
- Endorsements - the engineering of this seems like a good way to get a handle on the scope of how Rails works with experiment. Try to learn the flow of this
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/132958639262/what-it-means-for-endorsements-to-be-done

- Page views engineering. This seems cool. Look into it more and take notes on what you've learned:

### FAQ's and A's
- What's the purpose of the journal?
    - "The whole thing should focus on new and unique knowledge, made possible by this project."
    - "Teach the reader something new and interesting!!!!"
    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/134310590512/how-to-make-results

    - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/134808642902/knowing-our-emails


### Otherses
- Why endorsements?
    - Cindy: "Having endorsements as part of the product is beneficial to our team because it requires the researcher to get at least 2 more qualified scientists to review their project and gets the scientist to share the project with at least two people outside of our team. These endorsers could potentially be some sort of â€˜spirit animalâ€™. They donâ€™t generally know too much about the crowdfunding process but they can provide feedback on whether or not the project is clear and concise. They also provide feedback on whether or not the science is sound." - https://xclassifiedxexperimentsx.tumblr.com/post/130623603632/turning-our-humans-into-computers
- Why do backers back?
    - "unless the end product is very very good, most backers prefer knowing that theyâ€™ve: 1) helped make something on a topic they care about, or 2) the thing theyâ€™ve helped fund has been picked up and published by a big publication. Most of the time, people donâ€™t care that much about the end product, and would rather feel good about themselves."
